# Shopping List App

This is a simple shopping list app that allows users to add, edit, and delete items from a list.

It's still under construction, but you can check it out.

## Future plans 

- [x] Adding a database to store the items long-term

- [x] Adding a home page where you can see multiple lists, instead of just 1

- [x] Adding navigation once there are multiple screens

- [ ] Adding an api to search for items to add to the list ~~or share lists with others, still deciding~~
